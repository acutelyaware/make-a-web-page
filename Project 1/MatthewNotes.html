					<b>What is The World Wide Web?</b>
				</div>	
					<div class="lessondescription">
							<p>The World Wide Web is comprised of a collection of <em>HTML</em> documents. When a person accesses a website through a web browser, the computer sends the HTTP request through a server and retrieves the correct HTML document, which the browser is then able to interpret and display. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"> This video</a> is a good explanation </p>

				<b>HTML</b>
			</div>	
				<div class="lessondescription">
						<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the language predominantly used for content on the web. It consists of <em>text content</em> (what you see) and <em>markup</em>(what it looks like). <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">The video here</a> is a good refresher.</p>

				<b>Elements and Tags</b>
			</div>
				<div class="lessondescription">
					<p>HTML markup consists of <em>tags</em>. Most tags have an opening and closing tag, with the content affected inbetween the tags, however some only need the opening tag. These are known as <em>void tags</em>. Tags and content together are known as <em>elements</em>. HTML documents consist of many elements. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"> Here</a> is a video that explains more.</p>

				<b>Inline & Block Elements</b>
			</div>
				<div class="lessondescription">
					<p> Elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an invsible box around the content, while inline just forces a line break. So far inline tags have been mostly void tags, while block elements are not.</p>

<h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document</h2>

				<b>Creating a Structured Document</b>
			</div>
				<div class="lessondescription">
					<p>Web pages are described as having a <em>tree-like structure</em>.  This refers to the way that elements can contain other elements, like Russian nesting dolls. In the browser these elements show up as boxes nested inside of each other. Every style element is a box.</p>
					<p>In Chrome you can use <em>developer tools</em> to view the code for a page. The tree-like structure can be observed as elements appear as sideways triangles that can be expanded and further explored. Additionally you can change settings in developer tools to see how it would affect how the code is interpretted.</p>

				<b>Text Editing Programs</b>
			</div>
				<div class="lessondescription">
					<p>While HTML can be written in a plain text document, specific programs called text editors make it simpler and more efficient to insert opening/closing tags, and inserting other coding needs. There are different types of programs that serve different uses. For example Scratchpad shows changes to code immediately, but is more suited for small projects. Sublime Text is much more powerful, but does not show results instantaneously.</p>

				<b>CSS</b>
			</div>
				<div class="lessondescription">
					<p>CSS is used to control and change the style of HTML elements. CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. The cascading part refers to the fact that the most specific rule applies to all elements. For example, a style applied to a larger element would also be applied to all of the elements nested within that larger element, unless otherwise specified. This is known as the concept of <em>inheritance</em>.</p>
					<p>CSS styles can be applied to a specific tag, for example to a bold tag, making all of the elements in the HTML with that tag be affected, or it can be applied to an entire class. This can be achieved by giving entire elements a class name, and then applying a specific style to that class</p>

				<b>Don't Make Me Repeat Myself</b>
			</div>
				<div class="lessondescription">
					<p>It is important to avoid reptition whenever possible. Reptition provides a greater chance for errors, and even 1 small error can affect the results of your code.</p>
					<p>Consistency throughout an HTML document allows for styles to be applied more broadly without reptition. For example in this document each lesson was broken into a <em>div</em> and given the same <em>class</em> name. This allows each lesson to be given the same style without having to repeat the style for each lesson, and allows to change the overall look more quickly.</p>
